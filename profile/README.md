Ocean & Coastal physical processes play a significant role in many aspects of human life. Ocean currents, Tides, storm surges and subsequent flooding, erosion and sea level rising, among other factors, have a significant impact in the risk associated with both assets and people.

Thus, there is a need to develop a reproducible workflow for estimating, to the highest possible accuracy, a consistent and seamless model of global oceans including coastal processes at resolutions that facilitate dynamic impact studies and provide up-to-date situational awareness. Such workflows could be continuously updated with new information as it becomes available.

The resulting framework needs to allow for enhanced participation and community endorsement, suggesting that the algorithms used should be portable, transparent and open-source. A comprehensive quality control procedure should also be developed. Dealing with such an inherently multiscale problem would require multiple solvers and numerical modules integrated in the most efficient manner.

This paradigm is already proven to work within the research community with projects such as [pydata](https://pydata.org/), [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) and [pangeo](https://pangeo.io/).

Our goal is to

•	Provide a comprehensive analysis of the problem at hand.

•	Take stock of the available research, datasets & numerical models.

•	Bring together all relevant scientific communities in an effective and productive way.

•	Promote interoperability and integration by supporting open source co-developement.

•	Champion reproducibility, data provenance and documentation requirements.

•	Identify and address gaps.

•	Inform research planning and funding at an inter-organisational global level for maximum coordination.

•	Research and demonstrate best practices in code management.

•	Support state-of-the-art numerical models and frameworks.

•	Enhance community participation with maximum uptake.

•	Bridge the gap between Research and Operations.

•	Participate in relevant initiatives.
